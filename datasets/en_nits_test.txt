Are you crazy?
I had a suspicion that he would leave me.
Tell me where the wine is.
Stay there.
She will give a party next week.
Tom has lots of friends.
We thought you might want to come with us.
Please come.
Tom wasn't able to figure out how to get the box open.
Tom didn't know Mary was in there.
I need this.
You're dishonest.
We must work as long as we live.
Step back.
Louder, please.
Lie still.
Pack your bags.
Step into the light.
I don't go anywhere without my camera.
Of course.
I didn't drink the water.
I know you have it with you.
Wash your face.
How much should you walk?
Wake up!
Too late.
Tom said Mary wasn't happy.
We don't need to waste money on things we don't need.
My mother used to read me stories when I was a young kid.
I am asking questions to my father.
I know that Tom doesn't know anyone who does that.
Please try one.
Tom had no idea that Mary was planning to stay in Australia for three more days.
Answer me.
Tom wants answers.
I'm so sleepy.
Tom is yellow.
The other day I ran out of gas in the middle of a busy Interstate.
I want you, Tom.
Come here.
Nowadays no one believes in ghosts.
Do you speak English?
You might get fired if you do that the way Tom told you to.
Didn't you know that Tom was Canadian?
Sign here.
He asked me a question.
Don't pay any attention to what your father says.
I've been expecting something like this to happen for a long time.
Stop meddling.
He came.
Can I see your ticket, please?
He runs.
Please don't tell us what to do.
When is school over?
He must have been ill.
Merry Christmas!
I could never fool you.
Tom didn't want to go there alone.
Do you know who Tom's mother is?
He is one of the greatest scientists in the world.
Tom wanted Mary to go away.
These are pens.
Why did you try to run away?
How beautiful!
I know that Tom would do that if he could.
Who's hungry?
What time is it now?
Take me to this address, please.
When was that?
Tom is being forced to do that.
Shoot!
Tom has no idea what he's doing.
Where did you see that?
The moon is shining.
Tom said that he thought I might not need to do that today.
The stars came out.
Did you pack this bag yourself?
Attack!
Tom said you have to be more careful.
Come here.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to imply anything.
Tom has told me he wants to write a book.
You're the biggest.
I'm not usually picky about food.
Pack your bags.
This job isn't as easy as it looks.
Get down.
This is good.
That's impossible.
Why do I need to learn French?
The situation is worse than we believed.
Look there.
Who else do you miss?
Tom gave his seat to an elderly lady.
What is the name of this river?
Give Tom everything he asks for.
Who cares?
I love this restaurant.
I found the key.
Tom and Mary were waiting for me.
You look hurt.
Stop filming.
The storm sank the boat.
I wanted Tom to play tennis with me.
I saw Tom give a flower Mary.
How annoying!
Tom was kneeling.
Please keep your voice down.
Everyone has been affected.
My mother used to read me stories when I was a young kid.
Why did you tear the cloth instead of cutting it with scissors?
Wait.
Tom is way too young to be doing this.
Eat everything.
Don't you want to stop Tom?
How old are you?
How did you know what Tom needed to do?
Tom's phone rang.
Never mind!
Tom is Mary's cousin, isn't he?
Stand still!
How do people like you get to be people like you?
He was awfully skinny.
He leaves at eight.
Ghosts exist.
Tom lives alone with his dog.
Look behind you.
I'm not the only one who's hungry.
Who are you?
Most Japanese temples are made of wood.
About how many days will you be in Boston?
Tom has already decided he isn't going to try to fix that.
What're you saying?
He showed us how to ride a horse.
How lovely!
Tom has promised he won't do that anymore.
Why did you try to run away?
Tom told his dentist that he brushes his teeth after every meal.
Tom handed the photo album to Mary.
Quiet down.
A telephone is more useful than a necklace.
Where did you see that?
Wash the dishes.
It impresses me that you know how to do that.
You should not do that kind of thing by yourself.
Tom has already taught me how to do that.
Follow me.
Keep it.
Please leave.
Tom nodded.
What do you do for the team?
Where's the director?
Tom and Mary want to go to Boston together.
Look behind you.
I have nothing to tell you about it.
How should I know?
Why can't animals talk?
What did you like the most about your previous job?
