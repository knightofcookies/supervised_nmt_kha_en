That was unfortunate.
You look hurt.
Please don't tell us what to do.
I hope you get a chance to come to Australia.
What was the first capital of Portugal?
I don't think Tom would let you win.
Tom is Mary's cousin, isn't he?
Help yourself.
Tom wants everybody to like him.
Tom is going to watch a movie.
Tom is going to hurt you.
Tom looks sad.
Please stop talking about that.
Where can I get some ice?
Cows eat grass.
Tom hit me first.
Look back!
Come here.
I did that the way Tom suggested.
Suit yourself.
Tom did the work himself.
I don't know yet.
Tom can't do it alone.
He asked me a question.
Pick the one you like best.
My battery is about to die.
Please write that down for me.
Tom said that he wanted to sit next to me.
It didn't just affect me.
I hope that Tom isn't going to be the one who does the driving.
We need to get this weighed.
Look there.
Tom used to have a dog.
You seem to ask Tom a lot of questions.
Tom cut his own hair.
You have no idea what you're talking about.
That's not how we do things here.
Why do you always ask so many questions?
Do you remember where Tom left his umbrella?
What Tom told us about how the accident happened wasn't true.
I'm here because I have to be here.
Tom is liked by his friends.
These chairs are different.
What is your name?
Are you crazy?
What languages do you know?
I understand why you're angry.
I want you, Tom.
Tom wanted to eat some ice cream.
Tom wanted to eat some ice cream.
Is this lake deep?
Stand up!
I'm sorry.
Tom did the work himself.
I thought that you weren't supposed to be helping Tom.
They cleared the pavement of snow.
I did that the way Tom suggested.
Tom had never thought of that before.
Remember it.
Eat slowly.
About how many days will you be in Boston?
Who else do you miss?
We want what's best for you.
My guess is that Tom isn't going to want that.
You should use a deodorant.
I need this.
Does anybody hear me?
I was hoping Tom would want to do that.
Tom thinks that you can take care of yourself.
How does that song go?
You could do that by phone.
How long did it take Tom to read this book?
Tom has asked Mary to help him.
I didn't tell everyone.
I don't think we're ready to leave yet.
When the house caught fire, an awful feeling came over me.
He wouldn't hurt a fly.
Tom fell off his mother's lap.
Ask Tom.
Tom thinks that you can take care of yourself.
Tom didn't tell anybody he wanted to do that.
The student refused to obey his teacher.
I think Tom would be able to do that if he really wanted to.
You don't have to go to school tomorrow.
Can you hear me?
Are you going to shoot me?
I bought the least expensive pair of shoes in the store.
I put my gloves on inside out by mistake.
Did you wait long?
Is the tap water here drinkable?
Tom and Mary stayed friends after they broke up.
Wood floats.
Please come again soon.
You're not the only one who's hungry.
Why did you buy this horse?
I know.
They're looking for Tom in Australia.
I don't know if Tom is coming or not.
I wish you'd quit throwing things at me.
Tom and Mary are outside.
You can't escape from me.
She teased him.
Tom asked me a lot of questions that I couldn't answer.
Tom is Mary's cousin, isn't he?
She's attractive, but she talks too much.
A pair of earrings is a nice present for her.
How should I know?
Tom didn't tell anybody he wanted to do that.
That hurts.
There were many of us who opposed that.
What is wrong with me?
She chatted with her friends about the baseball game.
Tom didn't keep Mary waiting too long.
He ran.
Tom didn't tell anyone he wanted to do that.
You have no idea what you're talking about.
Turn left.
I haven't been here in three years.
It's not weird.
Tom told his dentist that he brushes his teeth after every meal.
How wonderful!
It was only a bad dream.
Why do you need a comb if you're bald?
I'm too busy to talk to you now.
I love that chair.
Tom is yellow.
In fact, Tom told me never to come back to his house again.
It's different here.
It's still crowded.
He leaves at eight.
What're they doing?
A mother rabbit keeps her babies warm with her own body.
Can I make a phone call?
What else are you planning to do?
I won't wash your car.
Stop filming.
Tom splashed Mary and she splashed him back.
I need to put the children to bed.
Do you think I'm making a mistake?
Are these your shoes?
Do you think I'm making a mistake?
Tom seems sincere.
I'm sure you're very busy.
She picked flowers.
Goodbye!
How did you get permission to do that?
Please hurry.
Please hurry.
Do you remember where Tom left his umbrella?
Come along.
They were shocked.
Tom was glad to hear Mary's voice.
How nice!
You can't escape from me.
Please write that down for me.
Tom told Mary that he didn't love her.
Didn't you know that Tom was Canadian?
Don't you want to sit with me?
I thank you.
I'll get him to carry this box upstairs.
Shut up!
Wash your hands.
I can't put up with Tom's bad manners any longer.
Jump.
Cows give us milk.
Is this biodegradable?
We work for Tom.
Walk slowly.
How did you make them laugh?
I have nothing to tell you about it.
Good luck.
I've never worked in a restaurant.
Bears can climb trees.
This book isn't as interesting as the one I read last week.
The policeman captured the man who was running.
We need to go back.
Tom smiled when Mary looked at him.
She walks.
Who?
Where are you?
That man stole my purse.
You can't escape from me.
How could this sort of thing possibly happen?
I saw Tom running down the street.
Leave it behind.
Choose one.
How do you use this camera?
Do you know what this is all about?
We eat together every evening.
Do you know how much profit we made?
The earth rotates.
I know that Tom would allow us to do that.
It isn't that scary.
Help me.
You can tell me tomorrow.
Hello, Tom.
How are you?
I'll see if I can do that.
You didn't break it.
Tom came to see me on Monday.
Tom isn't going to do it again.
What are you doing?
We often eat fish raw in Japan.
He has ten cows.
Suit yourself.
Are you going to shoot me?
Tom is the only one who really knows what to do.
Tom asked me a lot of questions that I couldn't answer.
You should let Tom win.
She's attractive, but she talks too much.
We don't need to waste money on things we don't need.
What kind of a person are you?
You can't escape from me.
Freeze!
Stay calm.
What're they doing?
It's hot.
How cute!
Wow!
Are you sure that it's OK to drink this water?
I saw Tom running down the street.
He is in need of money.
They won.
What were you doing at that time?
I'm pretty sure Tom can do it.
Get up.
Tom might go to Boston next fall.
I remember that.
Louder, please.
I doubt that Tom will ever learn how to speak French properly.
I didn't take part in that.
Tom is more gullible than Mary is.
It's hot today.
It's refreshing.
Are you deaf?
What do you want?
What is the name of this river?
Tom knew he was supposed to do that yesterday.
Tom doesn't walk to school with the other kids.
I need you.
Do you have a steady boyfriend?
Where do you live?
No problem!
Tom is the strongest.
I'm going to Tom's office.
This is difficult.
Tom was the first one to get here today.
I have no energy.
It's your money, isn't it?
Where do they do that?
You can go if you want to.
Hurry!
We're still open.
Tell me.
This is good.
I don't think Tom knows much about his neighbors.
It's still breathing.
I got Tom to lend me some money.
You didn't break it.
I walked up the hill.
How many tickets do you want?
It's hot.
They're always there.
I don't dare tell him such a thing.
It never occurred to me that Tom wouldn't want to go with us.
If you go fishing tomorrow, I'll go, too.
Which is the newest one?
Why do you need a new television?
You're just not the person I thought you were.
Tom said he was hoping he and Mary could eat together.
I think that Tom could help.
Where's the fitting room?
Come quickly.
I did that the way Tom suggested.
Bear with me.
Listen.
I know that Tom would do that if he could.
Where's the director?
Mr. Jackson was a very bad teacher.
I know this is hard for you to understand.
Watch the road.
Why didn't you ever tell me that?
It's too hot.
Come quick!
You agree with Tom, don't you?
Look behind you.
You don't know the system.
They're looking for Tom in Australia.
I remember that.
Look behind you.
Why not?
Wash the dishes.
I won't let anyone help Tom.
Where do they do that?
Tom and Mary are outside.
I'll see you at home.
What would you like me to call you?
Sit tight.
I doubt that I could swim across this river.
I didn't know Tom had been married before.
I got Tom to lend me some money.
The toilet is upstairs.
They won't permit you to do that here.
Pack your bags.
How do you know Tom is there?
Tom and I both want to go to Boston.
Why are you late?
I feel bad for them.
I've lost my briefcase.
Run!
Don't ask me to help.
My battery is about to die.
We don't know much about what happened.
Tom and John pretended to be brothers.
Are you deaf?
Tom knew he was supposed to do that yesterday.
Tom wanted to be the first one to get off the bus.
Can I have a minute?
Come quickly.
The store will be closed tomorrow.
Tom wasn't very motivated to do that.
I have two cats.
What're you saying?
I don't want to go to school.
I've been up all night writing.
This is very good.
How annoying!
Are these your shoes?
You can go if you want to.
The sky brightened.
Watch out!
Tom put his pistol under the pillow.
Would you mind calling Tom for me?
Please come.
I know that Tom isn't in Boston.
Tom quickly opened the drawer and pulled out a gun.
Why aren't they here?
This is extremely important.
Wash your face.
Tom said that he wanted to sit next to me.
The heavy door swung open.
Who's your favorite Disney character?
Keep trying.
Calm down.
Tom never saw Mary.
See you tomorrow.
It's your money, isn't it?
Burj Khalifa is currently the tallest skyscraper in the world.
Is this biodegradable?
Tom lowered his voice to a whisper.
Tom will die without your help.
Does Tom want to come?
We've been to Australia many times.
I needed to talk to Tom, so I went over to his house.
Tom wants everybody to like him.
How deep?
Wood burns.
Let go of the rope.
You can go if you want to.
I used to go to Boston about three times a year.
You agree with Tom, right?
I'm going to drive you home.
I gave it my best shot.
Look there.
Where would you like to go?
I needed to talk to Tom, so I went over to his house.
You can't escape from me.
Everybody's got something to hide.
Who runs the fastest of the three?
Why doesn't he eat lunch with me anymore?
I laughed.
I wonder whether Tom would let me drive.
They quarreled.
Watch out!
Is it true you bit Tom?
Stop reading.
Tom didn't want to go there alone.
How should I know?
Read this first.
I don't want to know anything about that.
Come in.
I'm a Christian.
I hope you get a chance to come to Australia.
Just get up.
I know that Tom is a really nice kid.
I know Tom is a strange guy.
Tom didn't provide an answer.
Tom must've been very disappointed.
There's one more.
You didn't protect me.
You haven't even tried.
Don't ask me to help.
How many miles is it from Boston to Chicago?
Fire!
Tom put on his sunglasses.
Is Tom in surgery?
I was so cold.
Happy birthday!
My mother used to read me stories when I was a young kid.
Tom didn't do anything wrong.
She sat on the bed as her mother braided her hair.
These pants don't fit me.
I'm quite certain Tom has never done that.
Goodbye!
Please try one.
Where are you?
She looks very happy.
Tom is the only guy I know from Boston.
What do you like to be called?
Look at the picture.
You shouldn't believe everything Tom says.
I could never fool you.
I just need some aspirin.
Tom still hasn't told me why he doesn't want to do that.
Shut up!
What languages do you know?
Look back!
My battery is about to die.
Tom almost always wins.
Wake up!
Tom died a miserable death.
Don't you want to know?
How many nights will you be staying?
I'll see you at home.
You can't escape from me.
Tom is Mary's older brother, isn't he?
Would you mind turning the music down?
It's your money, isn't it?
Tom didn't tell anyone that he wanted to do that.
Tom smiled when Mary looked at him.
Stand aside.
Where is the toilet?
This chair is ugly.
Did anybody come?
You can't escape from me.
How did you know what Tom needed to do?
One day, she told me that she wanted a pet cat.
Follow him.
Your room is twice the size of mine.
Where can I get some ice for my knee?
Why would they need to do that?
You called?
Tom is the one who taught me how to play tennis.
Did Tom tell you where he was last night?
Tom is going to hurt you.
Tom cuts his own hair.
She walks.
Where would you like to go?
Tom apologized for not doing what he promised he'd do.
Will you please explain to me the exact meaning of the word?
We've got something.
How did you know what Tom needed to do?
I think I may know where to find Tom.
That news got around.
I don't know him.
Tom said that he didn't want to live in Boston anymore.
Stop reading.
We've been to Australia many times.
These pants don't fit me.
Be cool.
Did anybody come?
What if Tom is still alive?
How am I going to impress Tom?
Look behind you.
Will you guys please stop fighting?
They called you.
I don't believe they would do that.
Tom can speak French better than you.
Tom said it was all like a dream.
About how many hours a day do you study?
I don't think Tom knows that I'm not single anymore.
Why were you laughing?
I need to put the children to bed.
Lie still.
We must leave immediately.
How soon will the next bus be here?
You can't escape from me.
Definitely!
Tom tried to kiss Mary, but she leaned back.
It is raining.
You shouldn't believe everything Tom says.
How weird is that?
It's hotter than usual tonight.
Read this first.
Tom is eating potato chips.
Which is the newest one?
Tom thinks that you can take care of yourself.
I don't find this funny.
Hi.
What are those called?
A lot of people drowned when the ship sank.
How long do we have to wait here?
Tom said he knew Mary.
Tom went without food for a whole week.
Cows give us milk.
I know Tom is a bus driver.
Tom knows about this, doesn't he?
You're just not the person I thought you were.
That's something I'll never understand.
I bought a pen for your birthday present.
That man stole my purse.
Tell me where the wine is.
God exists.
I don't know.
Tom knew that Mary didn't need to do that.
Step into the light.
Even if my house catches fire it would soon be put out.
Did you happen to see her yesterday?
Tom is the only guy I know from Boston.
I didn't know why.
This is very good.
Sushi is delicious.
Tom said that he wanted to sit next to me.
I don't know.
Tell me how you found out that I did that.
I don't like this paper. It's too shiny.
What did you get exactly?
Are you deaf?
I don't like talking with strangers.
I can't believe that you did all this without any help.
He gave the same answer as before.
Tom lives here now.
This job isn't as easy as it looks.
What is the name of this river?
January, February, March, April, May, June, July, August, September, October, November and December are the twelve months of the year.
We understand.
I'm just joking.
My car is parked over there.
We must work as long as we live.
Drive safely.
This is the first time that Tom has ever complained about the food.
Tom is still paying attention.
I may have put the key somewhere in this room.
Speak softly.
Speak up!
I was jealous of you.
Ladies first.
I thought that you weren't supposed to be helping Tom.
Sit tight.
The toilet is upstairs.
What did you get exactly?
I advised Tom not to waste his time trying to do that.
Give me the keys.
If you know the answer to this question, please tell me.
I was looking for the barbershop.
Tom didn't tell anybody that he wanted to do that.
Tom stepped on some broken glass.
What is your name?
Stop!
You can't escape from me.
I'm not sure what I'll do.
Stop meddling.
Tom fell down the stairs.
Didn't you know that Tom was Canadian?
Stay.
What were you doing at that time?
That man stole my purse.
Seriously?
When is your birthday?
Tom told his dentist that he brushes his teeth after every meal.
I've been to Boston numerous times.
Tom shooed away the flies.
Turn right.
Tom doesn't live far from me, but I don't see him very often.
Drive slowly.
I can't believe we're all still here.
Everyone laughed.
He is in need of money.
What is your name?
I don't want anyone to see me with Tom.
Tom is being forced to do that.
I'm sure you're very busy.
Metal contracts when cooled.
Who runs the fastest of the three?
Read this book.
I'm pretty sure that Tom can do it.
I'm sorry.
We're going to the market.
Is it true you bit Tom?
They're looking for Tom in Australia.
She teased him.
I don't believe they would do that.
These pants don't fit me.
Jump.
Pull yourself together!
You could do that by phone.
We were pretty thorough.
Stuff happens.
I love you.
The moon has set.
You're not the only one who's hungry.
I'm going to Australia the month after next.
I want everyone to know what happened.
Where did you see that?
What is your name?
It's raining.
Tom was kneeling.
I'm very proud of our students.
What do you go by?
My name's Tom.
Tom is the one who taught me how to play tennis.
Tom and I became friends when we both lived in Boston.
Tom lay face down on the blanket.
It's really annoying.
They seem to know all about us.
I have dandruff.
Are you sure?
You should probably buy a ticket for Tom, too.
I wish that I were in Australia right now.
Where else would I go?
These pens are his.
Sweet dreams!
What are we waiting for?
You can go if you want to.
We often do what we have to do, not what we want to do.
Tom put his arm around Mary and kissed her cheek.
Come in.
Keep reading.
Who are you?
Tom is eating potato chips.
Nobody died.
Where are you now?
Please cover yourself.
Hurry!
You can't afford this.
Didn't you know Tom lived in Boston when he was a child?
Stand aside.
I love you.
Stop grumbling.
He spoke to me when he saw me.
Do you know how to use chopsticks?
Stay there.
I know we can take care of ourselves if we try.
I still can't remember the words to that song.
Stand still!
He asked me a question.
I should visit Australia, too.
Tom came here last night.
Where's the fitting room?
Catch him.
My mother used to read me stories when I was a young kid.
You're dishonest.
Wake up!
Tom hasn't been swimming in a long time.
Leave it.
I don't think I've ever seen Tom here before.
I'm just asking.
We did our best to help them.
Do you have time tomorrow?
I didn't mean to stare.
The toilet is upstairs.
The ship began to sink.
I'm losing business.
Is it true you bit Tom?
I've got one just like that.
A long time ago when Pluto was still a planet, there was a boy named Tom.
He is tall and strong.
British and Japanese cars have steering wheels on the right side.
How do you know Tom is there?
Tom acknowledges that he was defeated.
Tom had enough money to buy what he needed to buy.
Eat everything.
How do you know Tom is there?
It's pretty.
I know you have an essay to write.
Aren't you going to give me a kiss?
I didn't give Tom anything.
I was just getting ready for bed.
Goodnight, Mother.
My dog is obedient.
You're the biggest.
Tom was surprised how well Mary could swim.
Pick it up.
Smoke appeared.
Tom has found out Mary can't read.
Where are you trying to get to?
This job isn't as easy as it looks.
English is the language of the world.
Tom knew he was supposed to do that yesterday.
Tom is going to hurt you.
You can't escape from me.
I extended my holiday.
We need to go back.
We know.
She picked flowers.
Tom isn't sure that Mary knows she has to do that.
Thanks for everything.
Tom read the Bible in its entirety, from the beginning to the end.
I'll kick your butt!
Tom went missing last Monday.
Wash the dishes.
Tom threw a rock at one of my dogs.
I found the key.
What is the name of this river?
If you want peace, prepare for war.
We're really touched.
I don't know what I want to do.
Move quietly.
Are you sure that it's OK to drink this water?
They won't permit you to do that here.
I wish I were in Australia right now.
If they were Canadians, this problem wouldn't exist.
They exchanged hellos.
Hurry up.
I'm not eating this fish.
Bear with me.
Speak clearly.
Where do they do that?
Tom didn't take the kids to school today.
Tom is going to hurt you.
I knew Tom wouldn't do that for us.
Hurry!
I no longer need a loan.
Tom confessed that he had broken the window.
Who else do you miss?
How did you get down here?
Back off.
My grandmother suffers from osteoporosis.
The moon is shining.
He plays beach volleyball.
I just want to forget about it.
Give me the keys.
Why do you need a comb if you're bald?
I feel like going to Boston again.
Tom would never leave his family.
Jesus loves you.
I used to go to Boston about three times a year.
I know Tom is a new student.
Are you crazy?
We'll fail.
Let me off here.
I'm a house painter.
She's attractive, but she talks too much.
There's one more.
We want what's best for you.
There were many of us who opposed that.
Are these your shoes?
Come outside.
I know how busy you are.
I'm not sure who has my suitcases.
You seem to be waiting for someone.
How did you know what Tom needed to do?
Who cares?
We often eat fish raw in Japan.
I'm looking forward to seeing you and your family.
How many patients do you see in a week?
Tom just saved my life.
She wrote me a long letter.
Have you told Tom that his dog died?
Why were you laughing?
Are these your shoes?
My dog is obedient.
I didn't want to do it.
We'll go to any length to send our child to a good university.
Did you have a good sleep?
Have you already bought your ticket?
I've brought you a gift.
It took me by surprise.
The toilet is upstairs.
I don't think Tom knows much about his neighbors.
Tom began to move.
How long did it take Tom to read this book?
You could do that by phone.
I know that Tom is a Canadian citizen.
Step aside.
Pass me the pen.
Watch the road.
She picked flowers.
She sat on the bed as her mother braided her hair.
It impresses me that you know how to do that.
After you.
That man stole my purse.
Tom has lots of friends in Australia.
You run.
You shouldn't believe everything Tom says.
Just tell me what's going on.
I work.
I was hoping Tom would want to do that.
You're welcome.
This is difficult.
I've got beer.
Don't you want to know?
I denied that I was the one who wrote that letter.
You should not do that kind of thing by yourself.
I'm very pleased to be here.
I know how to swim.
Stand up!
The window is here.
Do you really want Tom to die?
I feel like going to Boston again.
It isn't that scary.
Hurry up.
Tell me a true story.
What is your name?
Please get out of the kitchen.
You should not do that kind of thing by yourself.
Tom told Mary that he didn't love her.
I remember that.
Do you remember where Tom left his umbrella?
She left the company after 20 years.
I'm sure you're very busy.
Wash your hands.
There's one more.
I think I may know where to find Tom.
What'll change?
I was just making sure.
Do you remember where Tom left his umbrella?
Stay.
Please try one.
Look there.
Tom confessed that he had broken the window.
Do you think I'm making a mistake?
I'll take the jacket.
Why were you laughing?
What are those called?
We'll fail.
Tom has found out Mary can't read.
He entered the bank disguised as a guard.
Tom is the strongest.
I know that Tom would allow us to do that.
I could hardly stand.
Where is the toilet?
I told my parents everything.
It's too late to try that.
We thought you might want to come with us.
I'll see you at home.
Where do they do that?
Tom was the one who cooked.
I didn't have any money and couldn't buy any food.
It's not weird.
Stay down!
When's dinner?
My car's in the garage.
I had already eaten before I arrived at the party.
Take it.
It's hot today.
Speak clearly.
You don't know Tom.
Goodbye!
I love you.
You can go if you want to.
There's gum stuck to the bottom of my shoe.
Please give Tom my best.
Which is the newest one?
We really like each other a lot.
You guys have too much time on your hands.
Why did you stop studying French?
I think I may know where to find Tom.
It's your money, isn't it?
Do you speak English?
Tom is the only one who really knows what to do.
Tom was the first one to volunteer to help us.
How did you know what Tom needed to do?
You really do ask a lot of questions, don't you?
Pardon me, but that's my racket.
I've spent most of my life here.
I don't know how to swim.
We've studied French for several years.
I just laughed because everyone else did.
They're always there.
Didn't you know that Tom was Canadian?
Turn around.
There are only books on the shelf.
I lied for Tom.
There is no necessity for you to do that.
Tom didn't do anything wrong.
Tom got out of prison after 30 years.
Call me.
When is school over?
Try again.
We need to get this weighed.
I want to fight.
You're just not the person I thought you were.
Hurry!
Who cooked?
Her mother lives in the country all by herself.
Tom thinks that you can take care of yourself.
Please try one.
What do you want?
He is eight.
Pardon me?
Speak softly.
Almost no one knows we're brothers.
You should let Tom win.
She looked at me.
Take me to this address, please.
Do you remember where Tom left his umbrella?
This is difficult.
I want another cup of coffee.
Did you buy me anything?
He was drunk and forgot to shut the back door.
The student refused to obey his teacher.
We could say that both of those balls are the same weight.
Come in.
Only Tom would know that.
He remained silent for a while.
Pull yourself together!
Tom told Mary to try harder.
He spoke to me when he saw me.
When I woke up, I was in the car.
Beats me.
You can't escape from me.
Do you know how to use chopsticks?
My mother used to read me stories when I was a young kid.
My shoes are brown.
Dogs have masters, cats have servants.
Stuff happens.
We should be getting back.
Perfect!
What are those?
Hello!
Please try one.
We're still open.
Cows give milk.
You can't escape from me.
How are we going to do that?
Tom will make you happy.
Tom soon caught up with Mary.
When does it begin?
Come along.
Tom said that he wanted to sit next to me.
Can you hear me?
He came.
I forgot.
I should never have left Boston.
You have no idea what you're talking about.
What were you doing at that time?
Tom is a couple of years older than me, I think.
I promised Tom I'd go to Australia with him.
How lucky can one guy get?
How do people like you get to be people like you?
These pants don't fit me.
Where did you see that?
I'll do what must be done.
Does Tom want to come?
Come here.
Tom has no idea what he's doing.
I'm not usually picky about food.
I didn't give Tom anything.
Tom says he wants to do that as well.
I didn't pick it up.
Choose one.
Tom went on a picnic with Mary and her family.
I remember that.
They're looking for Tom in Australia.
Tom said you have to be more careful.
Please don't tell us what to do.
Tom is going to hurt you.
We try.
I hate voice messages.
Why did you try to run away?
She picked flowers.
I told my parents everything.
What did you like the most about your previous job?
Don't you want to sit with me?
My mother used to read me stories when I was a young kid.
I know this is hard for you to understand.
I'm not sure who has my suitcases.
That's impossible for me.
I am eating rice.
Let me off here.
Tom knew he had hurt Mary.
Prepare yourself.
I think I may know where to find Tom.
I know how busy you are.
You might get fired if you do that the way Tom told you to.
Are you sure that it's OK to drink this water?
I told Tom I needed his help, so he helped me.
Stay down!
It took Tom several hours to assemble a bunk bed that the instructions said would take less than an hour to assemble.
Tom seemed to be unable to win.
Where would you like to go?
It is very cold today.
Please sit.
Tom was even busier than I was.
Why did you agree?
I extended my holiday.
This belongs to me.
Tom couldn't go to Boston with us because he didn't have enough money.
Come home.
This is difficult.
This chair is light.
I'm OK for now.
That book is a new book.
I want to go back to my friends.
I don't have time.
Hurry up.
Tom said I shouldn't tell Mary about the accident.
Glass breaks easily.
Smoke appeared.
What are those called?
Stop yelling!
Give Tom everything he asks for.
Tom borrowed some money from us.
I don't believe anyone anymore.
We will clarify what is true and what is false.
Tom lives here now.
Not everything Tom said was true.
Tom thinks that you can take care of yourself.
Stand aside.
Tom wants you.
I didn't really think Tom did that without any help.
You must keep quiet.
You can't escape from me.
Tom lowered his voice to a whisper.
Tom is the guy Mary is dating.
I'm not going to go back.
Who's hungry?
I think Tom hurt Mary.
I would like you to sing a song.
I won't wash your car.
She looked at me.
I'll never understand it.
More research is needed.
I'm here to stay.
Tom already knows you aren't going to do that.
What are those numbers?
Goodnight.
I'm so sleepy.
Tom has more free time than I do.
Smile.
Hello!
This is extremely important.
How much is admission?
You tried.
Tom has already spent all the money that I gave him.
Are these your shoes?
We've got something.
Ask a teacher.
Everybody knows me.
Have you washed your hands yet?
Tom probably tried it.
I'm so sleepy.
You might get fired if you do that the way Tom told you to.
I know that Tom doesn't know anyone who does that.
Tom lost his camera in Boston.
That's not how we do things here.
Thank you for volunteering.
Why are you all shocked?
I'll take my dog out for a walk.
Sometimes my dog barks in the middle of the night.
He kicked it.
What are those called?
Read this first.
Tom is going to hurt you.
Hurry up.
Tennis is difficult. I never know which way the ball is going to fly.
I have nothing to tell you about it.
I think that Tom is fat.
Listen carefully.
Look there.
I'll figure out a way to fix this. Don't worry.
Ask a teacher.
Where are you?
We thought you might want to come with us.
I know how busy you are.
What is your name?
Why don't you like me?
Goodbye!
Are these your shoes?
It took me by surprise.
This book is easy for me to read.
I want you to read this book.
When do you open?
I can't believe that you did all this without any help.
Tom was the one who cooked breakfast.
Don't you want to sit with me?
It's not weird.
You're dishonest.
Tom didn't come home until 2:30.
It's not weird.
They live downstairs.
Are you crazy?
Study hard.
Tom is going to Australia to live with his father.
How do people like you get to be people like you?
I could never fool you.
Do you know who left that box there?
How lucky can one guy get?
Take cover!
Is it rude to ask a woman how old she is?
Are you deaf?
Where is the toilet?
That was really sweet.
What problems did they run into?
Ask Tom what his plans are.
The student refused to obey his teacher.
Hide.
Tom passed out again.
I didn't pick it up.
I promise to do my best.
Tom locked himself in his room and closed all the windows.
Should we try to help?
I'm proud that my father is a good cook.
It's all you can really do.
Be still.
Who cares?
Work slowly.
Louder, please.
This is difficult.
That is mine.
We need to do that while we still can.
You decide.
What is your name?
Are they Japanese?
You can go if you want to.
Tom didn't come home until 2:30.
I don't want to know anything about Tom.
Pass me the pen.
Can you give me some time?
I agree.
You're dishonest.
Pardon me?
Eat everything.
Please don't tell us what to do.
You may do what you wish.
Tom lay face down on the blanket.
I don't remember if Tom lent me the book or if I borrowed it from the library.
Hello.
Smile.
I wanted what Tom had.
What were you doing at that time?
I didn't vote for you.
Watch out!
You decide.
I understand.
Is your school far away from your house?
Suit yourself.
Help!
Give me the keys.
My shoes are brown.
No kidding?
They're always there.
You're dishonest.
They're all scared of Tom.
Tom is just finishing setting up.
Am I still your boyfriend?
Tom has no idea what he's doing.
Do you want to come sit by me?
You're dishonest.
The truth is I told a lie.
Will you go out tomorrow?
Where are you?
Pull it open.
How long did it take Tom to read this book?
I don't want to disturb you.
How did you know what Tom needed to do?
I've got one just like that.
I just say what Tom tells me to say.
I wish you'd quit throwing things at me.
I just say what Tom tells me to say.
I'll take my dog out for a walk.
Tom's own father killed him.
Get up.
She cried.
I want you to kiss me.
Tom was the first one to get here today.
Where would you like to go?
He stood there for a while.
Give me the keys.
This is extremely important.
How are we going to do that?
I'll see you at home.
I know how busy you are.
Can either of your parents speak French?
Tom pulled out his key and opened the door.
Unbelievable!
I don't know what I want to do.
I can't decide which route to take to Boston.
Why would they need to do that?
My mother used to read me stories when I was a young kid.
My house is very cold.
I won't be staying in Australia very long.
He jumped over a ditch.
Tom lives in his own world.
Tom denied that happened.
Leave me.
I hope that Tom isn't going to be the one who does the driving.
I'll be right in here.
My name is Tom.
Tom passed out again.
Me, too.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to imply anything.
Tom can't believe Mary is really planning to go.
Go.
I lost.
Could you write that down for me?
Why do you need a comb if you're bald?
Do I have to make a speech?
Tom is the strongest.
Tom was only teasing.
A cat appeared from under the desk.
Tom thinks that you can take care of yourself.
Tom has his own bedroom.
Leave now.
I bought the least expensive pair of shoes in the store.
He found me a good job.
Tom didn't tell anybody that he wanted to do that.
Why does this have to be done?
How many tickets do you need?
Grab him.
Where would you like to go?
We agree.
Next time, don't drop it.
Really?
Please try one.
Tom cooked.
I did that the way Tom suggested.
I just got up.
Stop. That tickles.
We'll fail.
The whole family is out for a walk.
Please relax.
Are you deaf?
The captain was the last person to leave the sinking ship.
We've got something.
Please come again soon.
Everybody knows me.
Tom is the strongest.
This is the place where the incident happened.
Where would you like to go?
Can I please use your restroom?
Jesus wept.
What else is there?
I know how busy you are.
What are those?
Tom said he knew Mary.
These animals are friendly.
If I were going to tell anybody, I'd tell you first.
Why did you try to run away?
The river overflowed.
What would you like me to call you?
Look there.
Don't worry.
Are you deaf?
Will you please go there?
I've lost my briefcase.
Catch him.
There won't be a next time.
I don't think you need to tell Tom why you went Australia.
Louder, please.
Nuclear weapons are a threat to the human race.
Hurry!
Study hard.
You decide.
Tom was only teasing.
He is eight.
You seem to be waiting for someone.
Where is the toilet?
Cover your eyes.
It didn't go well.
They quarreled.
Tom isn't going to buy that car.
Tom had to pay a fine because he parked in the wrong place.
The hospital where Tom was born is in Australia.
My grandmother suffers from osteoporosis.
Pack your bags.
Tom didn't want to go there alone.
Relax.
Choose one.
Tom came here last night.
I know how busy you are.
I didn't know why.
I'm really worried about what might happen.
Is there a tennis court around here?
Tom is the strongest.
There is no necessity for you to do that.
About how many hours a day do you study?
Tom doesn't live far from me, but I don't see him very often.
I detest hypocrisy.
Tom didn't tell anyone he wanted to do that.
Each of them has his own car.
Tom doesn't like to play poker.
I can't believe that you did all this without any help.
You look hurt.
This is difficult.
Tom bikes to work.
It's too hot.
It's impossible to fix.
I should've told Tom why I was late.
It impresses me that you know how to do that.
Watch yourself.
I don't think that Tom would be stupid enough to do something like that.
If possible, I'd like to read more about the issue.
Don't you want to know?
Tom tried to restart the car, but couldn't.
You don't like it when I do that, do you?
Pick it up.
You decide.
Stop that!
Shut up!
She looks very happy.
What were you doing at that time?
Get away!
We should give this a try.
You seem to be waiting for someone.
Hey, relax.
Tom and Mary own the house up the street.
Who's hungry?
Tom and John pretended to be brothers.
It needs washing.
Who was taking care of Tom when this happened?
Where is the taxi stand?
I lied for Tom.
I wonder whether Tom would let me drive.
He can't stop him.
Tom and Mary weren't much help.
Tom has already arrived in Australia.
Kiss me.
Take care.
She cried.
Do you really not want me here?
Tom will be here with me.
Do you know who Tom's mother is?
I don't want to go to school.
It has been ten years since my father passed away.
Cool off!
Freeze!
What happened?
Give me a piece of chalk.
Tom won the election.
I want to eat something that's good for me.
Please come again soon.
I didn't expect to see Tom in Boston.
Don't make me stand here.
We've got something.
I'm going to Australia the month after next.
Shut up!
I wonder what Tom wants.
What were you doing at that time?
It's too late to try that.
Beef, please.
Tom hired me to paint his house.
Go.
I don't have any children yet.
Didn't you know that Tom was Canadian?
The student refused to obey his teacher.
What did you like the most about your previous job?
Tom said that he thought I might not need to do that today.
Why did you try to run away?
That hurts.
What do you want?
Everyone dies.
Tom is Mary's cousin, isn't he?
Tom told Mary that he didn't know how to play the saxophone.
There were many of us who opposed that.
Not everything Tom said was true.
I don't understand.
Didn't you know that Tom was Canadian?
I couldn't bear it.
Tom said he didn't remember much.
I'm so sleepy.
Where's the director?
People are speaking at the same time.
I know this is hard for you to understand.
Stand aside.
Tom cuts his own hair.
They quarreled.
Tom might've been abducted.
I'm a student here.
I'd visit Boston if I were you.
I can't get anything right.
It didn't work out quite like I intended it to.
Tom bikes to work.
What are those numbers?
I don't like this paper. It's too shiny.
Didn't you know Tom lived in Boston when he was a child?
We often eat fish raw in Japan.
Wash the dishes.
I knew Tom wouldn't do that for us.
Pick the one you like best.
I'll get him to carry this box upstairs.
I've been to Boston numerous times.
Nobody came.
Do you remember where Tom left his umbrella?
That book is a new book.
Be still.
What is your name?
Get lost.
Why didn't you ever tell me that?
We've come home.
Sit down.
Why didn't you ever tell me that?
How lovely!
I just say what Tom tells me to say.
You don't know Tom.
These pens are his.
I can't believe that you did all this without any help.
Tom hasn't seen Mary in months.
It didn't go well.
Tom shaved.
I don't know how to prove I wasn't in Boston.
They want Tom back.
Children need loving.
I have to go to the toilet.
About how many days will you be in Boston?
Look behind you.
Why did you try to run away?
Tom is a friend of a friend of mine.
You'll cook for us tonight, won't you?
I came because of something you wrote.
What's your name?
Tom had never thought of that before.
My mother used to read me stories when I was a young kid.
Where are you trying to get to?
Things aren't going as well as I expected.
Don't make me stand here.
Why do you need a comb if you're bald?
Tom didn't tell anyone that he wanted to do that.
What are we waiting for?
I was hoping Tom would want to do that.
I've got one just like that.
Fish, please.
Ask Tom.
You can't escape from me.
I thought that you already knew.
